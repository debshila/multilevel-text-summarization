# Multilevel Text Summarization
## Insight S19 Project
The goal of this project was to develop a way to make information of an unfamiliar knowledge domain ingestible for a naive learner. The project leverages Topic modeling using an LDA to identify underlying themes within documents in a specific domain, followed by making summaries within each domain. The assumption is that the topics would allow the learner to get a broad understanding of the domain, and give the learners the opportunity to prioritize information in the domain by their representation in the knowledge corpus. Additionally, the summaries will highlight the most important content within each topic.

For the purposes of this project, I focused on understanding the latent themes in privacy policy documents. The documents were available from the Usable Privacy Project (ACL/COLING dataset retrieved from https://usableprivacy.org/data)
